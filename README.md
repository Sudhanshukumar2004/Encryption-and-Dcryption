Secure File Management System
Project Overview**
The Secure File Management System is designed to provide a highly secure and efficient way to store, access, and share files within an organization. With the increasing risks of data breaches, unauthorized access, and cyber threats, organizations require a system that offers robust security mechanisms. This system ensures file integrity, confidentiality, and controlled access by implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA), role-based access control (RBAC), encryption, and audit logs.

The primary objectives of this project are:

To provide secure storage of sensitive files.
To ensure controlled access based on user roles.
To encrypt files to prevent unauthorized access.
To track all file activities with audit logs.
To allow secure file transfers with encryption.

6. Appendix

A. AI-Generated Project Elaboration/Breakdown Report

The project consists of multiple modules, including authentication, encryption, access control, and secure file transfer. It uses AI-driven anomaly detection to identify suspicious activity. The system leverages pre-trained AI models for facial and voice recognition, making it highly secure. Additionally, blockchain-based storage can be integrated for immutable file logging.

B. Problem Statement

With the rise in cyber threats, organizations face challenges in securing sensitive files and preventing unauthorized access. Traditional password-based authentication is insufficient, making it necessary to integrate advanced authentication mechanisms, encryption, and access control policies.
